Welcome to AMA Bot! This bot was made to create a running AMA board for people who want to be asked questions.

To get started, you can make your AMA using /addme.

You can ask questions on other people's AMAs using /ama {/users ID} {text}. If you want your question to be anonymous, ask your question to the person from your DMs with the bot.

You can send a reply to the person who asked you an AMA question by using /reply {question ID} {text}. Feel free to reply in a public chat or in your DMs with the bot!

To learn more, use /help.
